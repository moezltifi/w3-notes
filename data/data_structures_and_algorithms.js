        "<li>There are many different data structures and each differs in how they organize and store data, arrays order data sequentially, and place each value in its own location.</li>",
        "<li>There is no best data structure because the best data structure depends on what data you want to store and how your application will need to access the data.</li>",

        "<li>So we need a more objective measure than just distraint running time.</li>",
        "<li>And so what we do is we look at the number of steps that it takes to execute an algorithm and we call this the time complexity.</li>",
